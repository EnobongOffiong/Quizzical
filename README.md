# Quizzical

This is a ReactJS-based quiz application that dynamically fetches trivia questions from the Open Trivia Database API. Users can customize their quiz experience by selecting categories, difficulty levels, and other preferences. The app then displays the questions interactively, allowing users to answer them, track their scores, and choose to either replay the quiz or return to the settings to start a new one.
